*** Movie DB API KEY note***
The movie db api key is referenced at the code by a static string variable called "MOVIE_DB_API_KEY". This variable is defined in a public class called "ConstantKeys" and defined at "com.nanodegree.diego.popularmovies.keys" namespace. 
To run the project you must either create the same class and variable with your own api key or you can adjust the use of the api key in the beginning of the class "MoviePostersActivity" and add the api key reference however you prefer.
